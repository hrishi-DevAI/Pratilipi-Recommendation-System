# **Recommendation system for Pratilipi**

This repository showcases a step-by-step Neural Collaborative Filtering pipeline for recommending Pratilipis . The approach involves preparing data, building a Keras model with embedding layers, training & evaluating the model, and finally generating item- and user-based recommendations.


## **App Demonstration**

## **Objectives**

1. **Predict Future Reading Behavior**
    - Building a model to predict at least 5 Pratilipis that each user will read based on the user's behavior.
2. **Train/Test Split**
    - the train set should contain 75% of the data and the rest must have 25%.
3. **Model goal**
    - To Train multiple classification models and choose the one with good recall score, less overfitting and good accuracy.

    
## **Repository Structure**

- `notebook`
    - Contains the main Jupyter notebook (`project_notebook.ipynb`) where data analysis, model building, and evaluation are performed.
- `data/`
    - Directory for our datasets used.
- `streamlit_app.py`
    - Streamlit application to demonstrated how recommendations can be served interactively.
- `requirements.txt`
    - Lists the libraries and versions needed to replicate the environment.

## **Getting Started**

1. ### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/hrishi-DevAI/Pratilipi-Recommendation-System.git

```
2. ### **Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have `Python 3.10+` for the required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. ### **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
If using VSCODE make sure ipykernel is installed
```bash
project_notebook.ipynb
```
## **Data Analysis**
### **User engagement**
The following plots will demonstrate the `Number of Unique story read by per user` and ` Number of Unique user per story`
![image](image/read_per_user.png)
1. **Distribution of Number of Stories Read per User**:
    - Highly Skewed Distribution: Most users read very few unique stories, while only a small fraction of users read a large number of stories.
    - Power-Law Behavior: A few users are highly engaged, consuming hundreds of stories, but the majority consume just a handful.
2. **Distribution of Number of Users per story**:
    - Long-Tail Distibution: A small number of stories are extremely popular, being read by thousands of users.

### **Category Analysis**
the following plot will provide the Top 20 most popular categories.
![image](image/Popular_categories.png)
1. `Romance Dominates` - The "romance" category is by far the most popular, with significantly higher read counts than other categories.
2. `Novels & Suspense` - These two genres also have a high engagement, meaning users prefer long-format storytelling with thrilling elements.
3. `Family & Social Stories` Are Also Popular - Categories like family and social indicate that users also engage with stories that reflect relationships and societal themes.
4. **Niche Genres** (Lower Counts) - Categories like `horror`, `swahindi2`, `women`, `entertainment` `shortstories`,`fantasy`,`life`,`moral-inspiring` have relatively lower engagement.

### **Reading time**
The following plot will demonstrate peak times when users typically areengaged with pratilipis.
![image](image/Peak_reading%20time.png)
1. The highest user activity occurs between 4 PM to 6 PM, with the peak at 5 PM (17:00).This could indicate that users prefer to engage with Pratilipi content in the late afternoon and early evening.
2. There is a steep decline in activity from 10 PM (22:00) onwards, reaching the lowest points between midnight (00:00) and 6 AM.
3. There is a slight dip in activity around lunchtime (12 PM - 2 PM) before picking up again in the afternoon.

### **Most engaging content based on Published Date**
The following plot will demonstrate which year's published content are more engaging for the readers.
![image](image/Read_percent_by%20year.png)
1. The highest average read percentage is observed in 2021 and 2022, where it reaches around 95%. This indicates that newer content is more engaging to readers.
2. In 2015, there was a dip in the average read percentage, dropping to the lowest point (77%)
3. The sharpest increase happened between 2018 and 2019, where the average read percentage jumped from 83% to 90%.
4. From 2019 onwards, the read percentage consistently increased year over year, showing that more recent content has been well-received.

#### **The `Project_notebook.ipynb` file contains more indepth insights and a very detailed analysis of the data**

## **Model Overview**
1. **Neural Collaborative Filtering Architecture**
![image](image/neural_architecture.png)
2. **Loss & Metrics**
    - `binar-crossentropy` loss for read vs not read prediction
    - `Accuracy`,`Precision`,`Recall` and `F1 scores` for evaluation
4. **Recommendation strategy**
    - For each user, the model scores every pratilipi
    -  we sort pratilipis by predicted probability and take the top 5 as recommendations.

## **Results**

## **Example Usage**
1. **User-Based**
```python

test_user_id = "5506791978752866"  # Some raw user ID from your dataset

# Call the recommendation function
recommendations = recommend_pratilipis_for_user(
    user_id=test_user_id,
    model=model,
    user_encoder=user_encoder,
    pratilipi_encoder=pratilipi_encoder,
    train_df=train_df,  # or whichever DataFrame contains the pratilipi_ids
    top_n=5
)

print(f"Recommended pratilipis for user {test_user_id}: {recommendations}")
```
2. **Item-Based**
```python

#  Pick a pratilipi
some_pratilipi_id = '1377786227025240'  # raw ID 

#  Get 6 similar pratilipis
recommendations = recommend_similar_pratilipis_by_item(
    pratilipi_id=some_pratilipi_id,
    pratilipi_encoder=pratilipi_encoder, 
    item_embeddings=item_embeddings,
    top_n=5
)

print("Since you liked pratilipi:", some_pratilipi_id)
print("You might also like:", recommendations)
```
